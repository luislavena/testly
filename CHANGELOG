*0.3.0* (2008-02-09)
  * Refactoring Time!
  * Removed Setup/Teardown in favor for a flexible support:
    before_all -> works like setup (executed prior all the tests for that suite)
    before_each -> executed before each test
    after_each -> the opposite of before_each
    after_all -> works like teardown, get executed after all the tests and the
      last after_each
  * Assertions ending with '_error' will exit the test sub if fail
    (there is no point continue testing, a error is something fatal).
  * Removed test that are redundant (now we have better coverage).
  * add_suite and add_test were coded as macro to simplify suite/test
    registration.
    
*0.2.4* (2007-08-13)
  * Added string comparison assertions.
  * made it compatible with 0.18.1 version of FreeBASIC
  
*0.2.1* (2007-02-12)
  * Re-license code under MIT.
  
*0.2.0* (2006-12-30)
  * Enhanced internal testing of the library
  * Assertion syntax swapped: assert_equal(expected, actual), 
    corrected internal tests to reflect this change
  * Added error reporting to the OS (using end). 
    This will generate rake task to abort 
    (useful by cerberus -- continous build -- to detect a build failure).
  * Changed internals on how current suite and test is referenced.
    Split helpers from running implementation

*0.1* (2006-12-22)
  * Initial Release.
